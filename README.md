# Athena Win-KeX
Win-KeX provides a GUI desktop experience for Athena OS in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2). It is based on [Kali Linux Win-KeX](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/kali-win-kex) and adapted to systemd systems.

By Win-KeX, the user can work in three different modes:
* Window mode: start a Athena OS desktop in a dedicated window
* Enhanced session mode: use RDP for a more feature rich experience
* Seamless mode: share the Windows desktop between Windows and Athena XFCE application and menus
